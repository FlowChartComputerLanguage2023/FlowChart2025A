Notes:
points can be :
	a variable (leads to a path)
	An option (a list of possible values, enum ...)A keyword, or which option in a list of terminals
	This is a departure from the keywords making up the symbol name

/FlowChart = RuleName , GraphicName, Graphics
	RuleName must match the rulename in the /Grammar=RuleName ::= ...
	GraphicName Line
	Graphics is the format  ColorName1 XY, XY, XY ... ColorName2, XY, XY ...
		Where a new color name will start a new line in the symbol 
		The XY must be between -250 and 250 (for now)
	GraphicName = point (number)
		These will make the next point in the symbol (for a variable)	
		The point in the symbol will connect to a point in the flowchart.
		If Number is zero or not provided (which will fix where the attachment 
			point is then the next point will be used (which might be 
			anywhere in the symbol)
